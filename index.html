                        <br>
                        <p>The music lesson program at The Launch Pad is truly a cut above the standard music store experience. Everything is designed with performance in mind!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Students meet with one of our talented, dedicated instructors for 30 minutes each week, and right away we have them learning the music that inspires them. Our entire program and facility are designed to take learning music into a new dimension, that’s as collaborative as it is creative.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Once our youth students get the basics, it’s onward to our Rock Band program, where they have opportunities to rehearse, perform and record music with their peers and with the pros. The “lessons” they learn along the way? …teamwork, accountability, confidence and self-expression.</p>

                        <span class="answer">Absolutely, yes. There is nothing we take more seriously. All of our instructors are drug-free, and must pass a background check. And that's just the beginning. We seek out and recruit only staff members who are positive and encouraging people. If they don't fit that mold, we find someone else. In addition, we record video in every lesson room and display it live in our waiting area.</span>
